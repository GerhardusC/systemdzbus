# Systemdzbus

Interact with systemd through DBus with a convenient rust interface.
All of the code was automatically generated by the CLI tool 'zbus-xmlgen'.
From here I just copied the documentation from the systemd man page to
get good descriptions for each function.

## Usage

To find out more about how to use the Connection, see the [zbus library](https://docs.rs/zbus/latest/zbus/).

```rust
    use systemdzbus::{Connection, manager::ManagerProxy};

    async fn example_get_units() -> Result<()> {
        /// Create zbus connection. You can also use Connection::session() here.
        let connection = Connection::system().await?;

        /// Create proxy per zbus
        let proxy = ManagerProxy::new(&connection).await?;

        /// Use the methods on the proxy. These are the ones
        /// that are actually documented here
        let res = proxy.list_units().await?;

        assert!(res.len() > 0);

        Ok(())
    }
```

Because this is literally just the [zbus library](https://docs.rs/zbus/latest/zbus/), and I contributed
absolutely nothing special, I think it is async runtime agnostic.
I don't know, I've used smol and tokio.

## Purpose

The entire use of this project was for me to get documentation for the automatic
types generated by 'zbus-xmlgen'. I got tired of reading through the man pages,
so I brought the man pages into the function definitions.
